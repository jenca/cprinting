            Formats for presenting these cards to your customers come in many formats. The first step is determining if
             you have the need to personalize your cards at your location. Do you want to have the ability to laser
             print the cards on your laser printer? Do you require an embossing or thermal printer for our thicker 24
             or 30 mil single cards?</br>
            Or you may not want to do any of the personalization or mailing on-site, and if that is the case we can help
             you out there too. Cardinal Printing & Card Services can help you answer all of your questions. We will
             assist you in determining which card format best suits your needs. We can help you with design and
             typesetting - all of our cards are custom printed to your specifications with your individual company
             information/logo's, etc.
